I designed this sunglasses website with a modern, minimal, and premium look, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices. The layout was structured with a clear hierarchyâ€”starting with a simple header containing the logo and a contact button, followed by a hero section with a stylish background image and an animated text box. Below that, the featured products section showcases three cards with product details, prices, and ratings, while the contact form at the bottom ensures users can easily reach out. Tailwind CSS helped maintain a responsive and mobile-first design, ensuring the layout adjusts seamlessly on different screen sizes.

For the color scheme, we chose a light gray background with black text to keep it clean and elegant, while gold/yellow accents highlight key elements like discounts and star ratings, reinforcing a luxury feel. The design also includes hover effects, animations, and smooth transitions to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the experience. Simple validation logic in the contact form ensures proper input handling without unnecessary complexity. Overall, the website achieves a balance of aesthetics and functionality, making it visually appealing while keeping the user experience intuitive and efficient.
